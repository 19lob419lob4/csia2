Prerequisites to programming

a.	Running NPM start to initialize node project
b.	Installing packages Express/Mongoose/Body-parser/CORS
c.	Initialising new React Project 
d.	Installing packages Axios/Uniquid

Techniques used to create final product

1.	Express.js REST API (with Mongoose)
2.	Use of MongoDB Atlas for online database to save/load persistent data
3.	Use of frontend framework React.js
4.	Use of 3rd party libraries (Mongoose/Axios/Uniquid) 
5.	Complex data structure of array of objects containing an array of objects containing an array of objects

(a&b) I initialized this node.js project with the name of ‘backend’. Running the command ‘npm install’ will install all the node modules listed above in dependencies.
To run the backend server, the command ‘node app’ must be ran.

(c&d) Similar to backend, the I initialised the new react.js project under the name ‘frontend’. The two dependencies installed here are axios and uniquid.
Running the command ‘npm start’ will run allow for the web app’s interface to run.
